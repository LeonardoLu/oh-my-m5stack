# stopwatch — companion watch (M5Stack StopWatch)

A round watch face that hosts the shared `bot-ux` character. There is no elapsed-time
stopwatch mode in this app.

## Hardware

- Device: M5Stack **StopWatch**, ESP32-S3R8 (16 MB flash + 8 MB PSRAM), 1.75" **round
  AMOLED** 466×466 (CO5300 driver, QSPI). PlatformIO `board = esp32s3box` +
  `board_build.arduino.memory_type = qio_opi` + 16 MB partitions.
- Inputs: capacitive **touch** (CST820B) + 2 programmable buttons (BtnA/BtnB). Touch is
  the primary input; buttons are shortcuts.
- Power: **M5PM1** through M5Unified. Battery is derived from filtered VBAT; charging
  requires VIN plus the active-low M5PM1 GPIO2 charge state.
- Audio: ES8311 codec + 1 W speaker via shared `ux::sound::Synth` and the M5 PCM sender.
- RTC: RX8130CE via `M5.Rtc`.

## Integration with bot-ux

The hero bot renders into a dedicated 286×286 sprite. A fixed 178×178 sprite provides
the live settings preview. Both bot sprites and the full-screen sprite are allocated
once in `setup()` and checked before use.

```cpp
M5Canvas canvas(&M5.Display);       // full 466×466
M5Canvas botSprite(&M5.Display);    // 286×286 bot
botSprite.createSprite(286, 286);
bot.begin(&botSprite);              // reads size from the sprite
// each frame:
M5.update();
bot.update(millis());
bot.draw();                          // into botSprite
botSprite.pushSprite(&M5.Display, 90, 90);
```

The watch draws its own RTC clock, date and battery status. Bot overlays are hidden;
there is no Wi-Fi/signal placeholder. UI text uses a dedicated light ink because the
official bot treatment uses dark pill eyes.

## Input semantics

- Face: A selects a random mood from the complete shared set; B advances through
  every mood, while B double returns to automatic Idle. A face touch inside the actual bot body looks Front; one outside it
  follows that direction before returning to the selected mood. A stationary
  three-second hold on the bot opens personalization. A+B held together for three
  seconds opens settings, and Long B enters dim doze.
- Hardware touch bypasses the SDK gesture classifier: `M5.Touch.end()` disables its
  polling, then the app samples `M5.Display.getTouch()` every 8 ms and derives one
  press/release edge per physical contact. A stationary face hold becomes Long at
  two seconds; a release after more than one second cannot become a tap.
- A downward swipe recognized from a contact beginning in the top 20 px reveals the
  compact battery panel. Tap the panel to dismiss it; otherwise it closes after six
  seconds. Double-tap the visible time within 420 ms to open settings; panel taps and
  non-tap gestures cancel the pending clock tap.
- Settings and Bot Personality show four rows in a 288 px continuous list viewport. Shared
  ScrollModel follows finger displacement in pixels and applies bounded inertia;
  draw and hit tests use the same offset, and a drag cannot activate a row. Fixed
  One centered Done control sits outside list scrolling on every non-face screen;
  editors save through it and hardware Long A remains the cancel path. Buttons
  remain optional shortcuts. Touch feedback clears after release; only hardware
  button navigation keeps a selected row visible. Rows place labels on the left
  and current values on the right. Preview editors show up to two rows and scroll
  additional rows in their 120 px lower viewport.
  `ux::PointerSession` owns each settings sequence: 20 px vertical travel promotes
  list scrolling. Otherwise, release inside the captured original target within
  one second activates it, including after small drift or leaving and re-entering.
  Cancel inertia before target capture; use WatchControls for hit geometry.
  Color surfaces retain the pointer through drag and cannot activate Done.
- Any touch or A/B press wakes from doze and is consumed, so it cannot trigger the
  control underneath.
- M5PM1 single-click reset is disabled without changing double-click power-off or
  download behavior. `BtnPWR.wasClicked()` returns to the face, cancels an unsaved
  editor snapshot and consumes the active gesture. The green PM status LED is a
  persisted Display setting and defaults off.

## Behavior

- Face: RTC `yyyy/mm/dd {weekday}` and time share one information block. A hideable
  English/Chinese description occupies the other band; Layout swaps these regions. Battery
  has no permanent percentage; its factory-inspired top panel slides in over 300 ms
  and shows percentage, a horizontal gauge, green charging fill and bolt.
- Settings is a scrollable hierarchy: clock, Bot Personality, display/sound and Done.
  Personality includes expression, action, shape, eye style, HSV color, action amount
  and speed, naming, English/Chinese UI, all 960 independent combinations and a live
  gaze selector. Chinese mode also localizes keyboard action labels. The HSV picker
  previews live and Done persists it.
- NVS persists 12/24-hour format, seconds, theme, shape, eye style, custom HSV body
  color, expression, animation, wrist response, motion amount/speed, brightness and
  sound, PM status LED, name, language, gaze direction, caption visibility and swapped
  layout. Gaze is Auto plus Center/Left/Right/Up/Down and four diagonals. RTC hardware
  persists time/date.
- BMI270 tilt passes through a low-pass filter and dead zone. Shake uses hysteresis and
  a seven-second cooldown before poke. Auto expression shuffles among calm ambient moods
  every 26–48 seconds; direct interaction postpones rotation for 60 seconds.
- Rendering targets 16 ms active / 33 ms preview / 250 ms dozing. The face pushes only
  the bot region; disjoint clock/status regions redraw when their values change. A fixed 466×90
  HUD canvas (83,880 bytes) provides coverage text/shapes without panel readback.
  Scrolling pushes only the 466×288 list band; static chrome stays cached. Serial
  `PERF` summaries report real frame timing for hardware validation.
- Serial `c` remains raw RGB565 capture. Diagnostic pages accept `vNN` plus newline:
  0 face, 1 settings, 2 personality, 3 expression, 4 appearance, 5 motion, 6 color,
  7 display, 8 scrolled settings, 9 scrolled personality, 10 battery panel, 11 format,
  12 name, 13 combinations, 14 layout, 15 language, 16 Chinese face, 17 swapped
  face, 18 fractional scroll, 19 animated scroll timing, 20 Happy/Joy/Wave preview, 21 gaze, 22 Thinking dots.
  `contact 1|0 x y` replays raw contact through `TouchContact`, gesture arbitration
  and the current screen handler; `physical` returns to CST820B sampling.
  `td/tm/tu x y` remains a direct UI-pointer diagnostic. Optional `@N` is echoed in
  the `UI seq=N` acknowledgement. `ui` reads state; `sound N` previews a cue.
  Both replay paths remain separate from hardware touch-controller acceptance.
  Language/layout diagnostics restore settings when leaving; no NVS write.
  Single digits remain accepted for compatibility; page selection never saves NVS.

## Rules

- Match existing code style; keep comments purposeful. No per-frame heap allocation.
- Keep the state machine in `main.cpp`; modules are plain classes.
- Persist settings with `Preferences` (NVS). Do not over-engineer edge cases.
- The user's current goal and `specs/touch-gaze-iteration.md` supersede older stopwatch notes.
- Keep the final contact replay and on-device evidence in
  `specs/touch-gaze-validation.md`.
