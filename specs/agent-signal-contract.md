# Core2 agent lighting signal projection

`core2/bot-ux-codex-core2/include/AgentSignal.h` is a pure C++ helper. It projects
signals emitted by the locally inspected Codex app build, rather than claiming
a complete task-state protocol. It does not own BLE, the display, sound, or BotUx.

## Verified mapping

| Exact RGB24 color | Official status | `agentsignal::Signal` | UI text |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0x304FFE` | working | Working | Working |
| `0xFF6D00` | awaiting-approval or awaiting-response | NeedsInput | Needs input |
| `0x00FF4C` | unread | NewReply | New reply |
| `0xFF0033` | error | Error | Error |
| `0xFFFFFF` | idle | Idle | Idle |
| effect off, or zero color with solid/breath | lights off | Off | Lights off |
| no app-ready transport / unknown color or effect | unknown | Unknown | Unknown |

Decode RGB24 before any RGB565 conversion; never use nearest-color guessing.
The inspected per-slot writer emits solid (1) or breath (4). Other nonzero effects
are Unknown, even if their base color resembles the status palette. Brightness
is a user preference: brightness zero alone does not erase a known status color
with solid/breath effect. Off describes lighting, not task assignment or completion.

## Evidence in the inspected official app bundle

The bundle copies are research artifacts under `tmp/codex-hid-research/`; the
semantics and limitations below are retained here so that scratch files are not
the sole implementation contract. Offsets disambiguate minified one-line files.

- `webview/assets/codex-micro-slot-signals-1d809a417a41.js:1`, function `Oe`,
  character offset 3252: local error wins; then approval/response pending chips;
  then loading maps to working; then unread; otherwise idle. Remote failed maps
  to error, pending/in_progress to working, then unread, otherwise idle.
- `webview/assets/app-initial-86767c3d23e5.js:1794`, `Vvt`, offset 1998331:
  defines the exact color table above. Both pending-input kinds share orange.
- `service-readable.js:1`, `$`, offset 28062: emits `status` color per slot,
  selected or pulsing gets breath, otherwise solid. **Breathing is not working.**
- `node_modules/@worklouder/device-kit-oai/dist/rpc_api_oai/rpc_api_oai.js:139`:
  `sendThreadsLighting` serializes only id/c/b/e/s/sk/sa into `v.oai.thstatus`.
  No task identifier, title, semantic status string, completion event, or host
  revision is carried. Optional fields leave existing device fields unchanged;
  the caller therefore supplies the merged LightingState snapshot to the model.

## Information that the wire does not preserve

There is no Done state. Green means unread, not confirmed successful completion.
The slot-signals `Te` function turns selected+focused unread into idle. Idle can
also represent a custom command slot without a task. Approval and response cannot
be distinguished. Slot numbers 1–6 are physical assignments, not task IDs.

`service-readable.js:1` `applyInactivityLightingOff` sends six off slots when the
lighting timeout expires. All-off does not establish unassignment or task ending.

`webview/assets/codex-micro-bridge-7749dc2a7114.js:1`, offset 12022, permits
onboarding, mini-game and composer-navigation overrides of slots. `Ft` (offset
5305) can produce an error-colored first slot for navigation. The onboarding and
mini-game modules also supply synthetic slot arrays. The transmitted fields do
not expose these override origins. Source-grounded color decoding is useful as
a display projection, but it cannot guarantee that every received color is an
actual agent transition. Do not present a success claim or run automation based
on this signal alone. A future semantic host extension would be required for
reliable identities, distinct needs-input reasons, and completion events.

## API and integration

- `decode(const LightingZone&, bool ready)` and `name(Signal)` are stateless.
  `ready` is the full Codex app handshake readiness, not BLE pairing alone.
- After reconnect, gate `ready` on a fresh thread-lighting snapshot, or clear the
  caller's cached slots on disconnect. A stale pre-disconnect LightingState
  presented as ready can otherwise consume the silent baseline before the new
  host snapshot arrives. RGB config receipt alone is not evidence of fresh slots.
- `Model::update(const LightingState&, bool ready, uint32_t nowMs)` returns a
  six-bit notification mask. Call from the main loop with a coherent snapshot.
- `Model::slot(i)` exposes `Snapshot { zone, signal, revision, changedAtMs }` for
  a valid zero-based slot index. `Model::revision()` covers the whole model.
- A slot revision increments when signal or any zone field changes. Its timestamp
  records that change; duplicate packets do not restart animations. The global
  revision increments once per update containing at least one changed slot.
  These are local display revisions, not revisions supplied by the host.
- Disconnect clears displayed snapshots to Unknown. The first app-ready snapshot
  establishes a silent baseline. All-off suspends the baseline; restoration is
  silent. Unknown/Off-to-known transitions also establish evidence silently.

For UI color interpolation, retain the previous rendered color when a new local
revision arrives. Use the snapshot's original host color for the card background;
select contrasting text and a separate selected border/slot badge. Bot follows
only the selected slot: Working → Working/slow Orbit; NeedsInput → Waiting;
Error → Blocked; Idle → Idle/Calm; Off → neutral or Sleepy. NewReply may receive
a short happy visual acknowledgment followed by a settled pose. That visual is
not evidence of completion. Choosing another slot is not a task-state transition.

## Notification behavior

A changed known active signal entering NeedsInput or Error, or Working → NewReply,
may set its slot bit once. First snapshots, reconnect snapshots, inactivity
restoration, unchanged states, and Unknown/Off transitions do not alert. Default
cooldown is 2500 ms independently per slot, configurable through the Model
constructor. A cooldown-suppressed event is dropped, not replayed later. Timing
uses unsigned elapsed subtraction so `millis()` wrap is handled normally.

The main UI can collapse simultaneous bits into one short sound and highlight
all affected cards. Follow the user's audio preference; preserve the selected
Bot even if a different slot needs attention. Wording is “Needs input”, “Error”,
or “New reply”, never “Task complete”. Native host overrides and slot reassignment
remain intrinsically indistinguishable; cooldown and baseline handling reduce
noise but do not prove event identity or remove that protocol limitation.

## Host validation

Run:

```sh
c++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror \
  -Icore2/bot-ux-codex-core2/include \
  core2/bot-ux-codex-core2/test/agent_signal_test.cpp \
  -o /tmp/agent-signal-test
/tmp/agent-signal-test
```

Tests cover exact/unknown colors and effects, brightness-zero semantics,
ready-versus-connected distinction at the API boundary, duplicate packet
revisions, effect-only presentation changes, transition notifications,
independent cooldowns, no delayed replay, reconnect and all-off restoration
baselines, unknown-to-known suppression, and time wrap. They run without Arduino,
M5GFX, BLE, sound, or display dependencies.
