# Thinking and Working orb motion — 2026-09-09

This iteration replaces the earlier three-dot Thinking glyph and the
anthropomorphic Working face with two related volumetric point-shell states.
Both states replace the avatar silhouette and eye overlay. The Watch and Core2
continue to supply the existing BotUx style; `bodyColor` colors the points and
`bgColor` remains the field behind them. The reference pill and label belong to
the surrounding product UI and are not drawn by BotUx.

styles with default controls. The reference catalog and browser metadata show
many small depth-shaded points forming a tilted sphere. They describe Breathe
as a 3.6-second point shell whose inflation travels between latitudes, and
Vortex as a 4.4-second surface drain whose points move along meridians toward
the north pole, fade out, re-enter at the bottom, and counter-rotate. The M5GFX version
adapts that behavior to native primitives; it does not copy a shader or draw
the reference status pill.

Thinking distributes points over a sphere and applies a subtle delayed radial
swell at each latitude while the shell turns. It should read as coordinated,
deliberate breathing rather than three independent loading dots.

Working continuously advances points from the bottom to the top along sparse
diagonal meridian streams. Points fade near both poles so the wrap has no flash,
and the shell turns in the opposing direction. Open lanes and a ring-like
negative space distinguish it from Thinking even though both share the same
dot material and depth model.

## StopWatch legibility and timing tune

The initial native implementation used 3.6- and 4.4-second base periods,
48/72/96 points, and `max(0.55 px, 0.0086R)` for the base point radius. The
StopWatch multiplies phase by both animation speed and motion amount. With its
verified saved level-two settings (`speed=0.73`, `amount=0.55`), those original
periods computed to 8.97 and 10.96 seconds. The audited device also had wrist
motion disabled; an app coupling incorrectly enabled reduced motion too, making
the computed periods 44.83 and 54.79 seconds. These values are calculated from
the code and read-only settings audit, not optically measured periods.

The tuned base periods are 1.6 seconds for Thinking and 1.4 seconds for Working.
The same verified level-two settings now compute to 3.99 and 3.49 seconds. The
StopWatch separately removes the wrist/reduced-motion coupling: wrist sensing
only gates IMU input, while the shared explicit reduced-motion API remains
available. Explicit reduced motion still applies its 0.20 phase multiplier.

The first timing tune used `max(0.70 px, 0.014R)` point radius and 32/48/72
points on a `0.77R` shell. It roughly doubled average cluster ink at the 286 px
Watch profile, but its footprint and overall mass still read much smaller than
the regular Bot body.

The final scale pass uses a `0.95R` shell, `max(0.90 px, 0.030R)` point radius,
and 32/64/96 points. Canvases whose body radius is below 34 px use a `0.85R`
shell so the minimum-radius points retain a safe margin. Thinking's breathing
swell is 0.11. The depth opacity floor rises from 0.07 to 0.12 and uses
`0.12 + 0.88 × depth^1.35`, keeping rear points visible without flattening the
front-to-back hierarchy. The larger footprint matches the regular body while
Working retains its open band and sparse stream structure.

## Native rendering contract

- Particle count is fixed for a given size: 32 below a 34 px body radius, 64
  below 60 px, and 96 at larger sizes.
- Particle state uses a fixed 96-element stack array (about 1,920 B with the
  current compiler layout). Drawing performs no heap allocation and creates no
  secondary framebuffer.
- Each point is an existing zero-length capsule. Its distance-field edge blends
  against the actual RGB565 pixel already under it, so overlapping points do
  not cut background-colored fringes into one another. A zero-length fast path
  evaluates the equivalent circular distance directly, avoiding capsule segment
  projection for every candidate pixel. For fully covered circle interiors it
  caches the body-over-background blend, but uses that value only when the pixel
  read from the canvas is still the background. Overlapping points continue to
  blend against their actual underlying pixel, and edge coverage is unchanged.
  No dynamic buffer is introduced. Working reuses its meridian sine for both
  ring geometry and pole opacity.
- A fixed tilt, perspective projection, depth-scaled radius, and depth fade
  establish volume. Back points draw before front points.
- `Animation::Auto` uses the shell's own motion without the legacy Orbit translation.
  An explicitly selected Animation still translates the complete shell through
  the existing choreography layer. The renderer constrains the complete shell
  centre against its measured point extents and a two-pixel margin, preserving
  rigid point geometry instead of clipping individual points at the canvas edge.
- `setAnimationSpeed()` scales phase. Motion amount progressively scales shell
  travel and the Thinking deformation; zero freezes every particle. Reduced
  motion applies a 0.20 multiplier to both phase travel and deformation.

## Host validation

`lib/bot-ux/tools/host-preview/test-orb-motion.sh` compiles a separate C++11
focused test against the RGB565 host canvas. It checks both moods at 40, 72,
178 and 286 px, including in-bounds drawing, absence of eye ink, populated
point clusters, speed equivalence, distinct silhouettes, low/reduced/zero
motion behavior, exact 1.6/1.4-second base periodicity, adjacent phase-wrap
continuity, and Vortex pole re-entry. It also checks the level-two StopWatch
profile, that explicit expressions cannot restore eyes, and that explicit
animation translation remains visible. Maximum motion covers all eight
Animation values over twelve phases at every target size. The 286 px Watch
profile stays within 90–110% of the regular body on each axis; discrete 32-point
small shells use a 75–115% compatibility envelope. Sixteen native 120 px frames
cover one computed StopWatch-profile cycle for each mood.

## Validation result

The first timing tune raised the 286 px StopWatch-profile Thinking frame from
796 pixels in 90 clusters to 1,231 pixels in 70 clusters, and Working from 708
pixels in 90 clusters to 1,033 pixels in 65 clusters. The final scale pass
contains 5,914 pixels in 80 clusters for Thinking and 4,989 pixels in 74 clusters
for Working: 4.80× and 4.83× the first-tune ink. Their sampled bounding-box ink
occupancy is 11.28% and 10.03%, so Working retains substantial negative space.

Across sixteen Watch-profile phases, Thinking spans 213–242 × 224–234 px and
Working spans 219–226 × 224–229 px, compared with the regular body's 223 ×
223 px. Both exact period wraps, native target sizes, speed equivalence, eye
suppression, explicit-expression suppression, explicit-animation composition,
rigid containment, and reduced/zero motion passed.

The circular fast path was compared byte-for-byte with the generic capsule path
across 320 native frames spanning both moods; 40, 72, 120, 178 and 286 px
canvases; eight phases; and standard, Watch, reduced and maximum motion profiles.
Every RGB565 frame matched, so the catalog did not need another encoding pass
after this rendering optimization.

The complete `tools/check_host.sh` gate passed, including the Watch and Core2
host contracts, shared BotUx preview, and focused orb suite. The final Core2
PlatformIO build used 60,464 B RAM and 1,511,797 B flash. Before the final scale
pass, the coordinated Watch build used 48,928 B RAM and 1,061,789 B flash; its
firmware image was 1,062,160 B with SHA-256
`8af0d34570b6578bbe4bcea7a760e06598d24d71aac984bca578ff28914ab930`.
That intermediate deployment's native 466 px captures visually confirmed its
larger points and open Working band. Thinking sustained 40.3–40.4 FPS and
Working 39.1 FPS, compared with 41.4 and 38.7 FPS before the timing tune.

The final full-scale Watch build used 48,928 B RAM and 1,062,785 B flash; its
firmware image was 1,063,152 B with SHA-256
`a25f5b2390208a88a982e8ed8cacb99fbf7f53f714634895a173cd2f59757d7f`.
On-device native timing reached 30.1 FPS for Thinking and 29.7 FPS for Working.
Working remains slightly below the internal 30 FPS target, while the final
visual size, density, depth and open-band result were accepted. Boot, firmware
hash verification and restoration to automatic mode passed.

The native catalog was regenerated from the final C++ renderer with 32 entries:
14 moods, 10 expressions and 8 animations. The checked-in Thinking and Working
GIFs contain 72 RGB frames at 120 px. Six-frame full-cycle comparisons showed
Thinking's evenly populated breathing shell and Working's moving negative band
and diagonal/ring streams; 286 px host captures retained visible front points
and depth fade. Final full-cycle Watch-profile evidence is in
`tmp/botux-orb-large-candidate/watch-thinking-120.gif` and
`watch-working-120.gif`, with six-frame sheets and a 286 px Idle/prior/final
comparison in the same directory. These captures were visually accepted. They
remain host raster evidence, not device frame-time, optical, touch, Bluetooth,
or serial acceptance.
